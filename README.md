# refractionware Linux repo

Welcome to my humble Linux fork. You're probably here because you're curious about my work on mainlining various devices. In any case, hello, and I hope you can find what you're interested in (spoiler alert: I'm probably slacking off on updating any of it...)

This README contains a general explaination of each of the branches within.

**Beware!** I prune old branches every once in a while to keep the repo uncluttered. Usually these don't contain anything interesting, I try to carry my patches across versions, but if you plan to link directly to something in these repos, maybe reconsider. Thanks!

## tab3/*

Branches containing code for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0. For an up-to-date mainline status, see the [wiki page on the postmarketOS wiki](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Tab_3_8.0_(SM-T310)_(samsung-lt01wifi)) (pretty much any change I make, or bug I find, I instantly write down there, even if it's not in my repos yet!)

In general, if you're looking for my Tab3 work, I am currently pushing it to my GitLab repo at https://gitlab.com/knuxify/linux, which is a fork of the [exynos4-mainline/linux](https://gitlab.com/exynos4-mainline/linux) repo, see the `tab3/6.5.1` branch there.

Sometimes though, I'll push some updates here. (This will probably also become my go-to repo for in-dev work if I ever do anything more involved, but in general, I use the GitLab repo since I make MRs to the exynos4-mainline repo from it.)

- `tab3/6.5.1`: latest work, based off exynos4-mainline Linux 6.5.1 kernel.
- `tab3/wip-otg`: (this should be moved to `wip/`...) Patch for MAX77689 MFD to 1. fix cable detection and 2. enable OTG. Does not handle OTG power yet. Also doesn't have working peripheral/OTG switching. Also also is missing at least one commit, be warned. This one should be re-done from scratch...

## baffinlite/*

Branches containing work-in-progress code for Broadcom Kona support. It's rare that I push these here; most of them reside on the [bcm-kona-mainline/linux](https://github.com/bcm-kona-mainline/linux) repo.

*No such branches at the moment.*

## wip/*

Work-in-progress branches, as the name may suggest. Usually a few hacky commits, though sometimes I put in the effort to keep things upstreamable from the start. I usually just push these so that I can snapshot my progress, or quickly share some concepts, so readability isn't exactly a priority.

- `wip/bcm59054-redo`: I submitted a patch to add BCM59054 support to the regulator, and somebody suggested that the whole thing could be done better so I rewrote most of the driver. Theoretically the rewrite part is done, now to extend it to add bcm59054 support...

## patchset/*

Branches where I prepare patchsets for submission, and try to figure out the order. Very rare, since I tend to jump directly to b4 to prepare patches.

*No such branches at the moment.*

## b4/*

Patches as they are submitted to the mailing list. See the list below for the branches accompanied by relevant lore links:
